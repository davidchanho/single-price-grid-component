## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS variables and mixin
  - Flexbox
  - CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

I furthered my knowledge and utilized CSS Grid. I generally used flex box but wanted to incorporate CSS Grid more when its called for. I wanted to challenge myself by not relaying less on bootstrap and other css frameworks grid systems.

### Continued development

I am still not as comfortable with CSS Grid right now but I going to use it more often replacing bootstrap grid.
